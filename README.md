# Required Software
It uses Docker CE and Docker-compose: Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

Install Docker CE :

Install Docker-compose :

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

After installing Docker and Docker-compose on your machine, you can go to the project main folder and type:

$docker-composer build

$docker-compose up

Docker-compose will build the containers necessary for your environment. Basically there will be two containers, one with Python, Flask and a few modules and another container with MongoDB bound to the first. The environment structure is as follow:
Frontend - Python/flask
Mongodb - Database to save complaints
